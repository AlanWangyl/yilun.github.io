"Which Data Tells the Truth? A Multi-modal Deep Learning Framework for Stock Price Movement Prediction" [Latest Version](https://yilun.github.io/files/job_market.pdf)

<p> Abstract: We introduce a novel multimodal data framework for stock price movement prediction, combining stock graphical, market, and text modalities. Our model addresses two key challenges in return prediction about how to extract signals from different types of data and which type of data dominates others. Using a 20-year US stock market dataset, we show that deep learning and language models efficiently capture critical features, with time series data proving more influential than graphical and text modalities. The framework's attention mechanisms and weight allocation effectively reduce conflicts between modalities. Our best-performing model, Fusion(AW), achieves over 70% balanced accuracy and a Sharpe ratio of 4.33 annually, outperforming single- and dual-modal approaches. Out-of-sample tests during recessions demonstrate the model's resilience in volatile markets. This research has broad implications for investment decision-making and paves the way for further exploration of multimodal data in financial modeling. </p>
