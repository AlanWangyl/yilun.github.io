"Which Data Tells the Truth? A Multi-modal Deep Learning Framework for Stock Price Movement Prediction" [Latest Version](https://yilun.github.io/files/job_market.pdf)

Abstract:This paper introduces a novel multimodal data framework for stock price movement prediction, combining
stock graphical, market, and text modalities. Our model addresses two key challenges in return prediction about how to
extract signals from different types of data and which type of data dominates others. Using a 20-year US stock market
dataset, we show that deep learning and language models efficiently capture critical features, with time series data prov-
ing more influential than graphical and text modalities. The framework’s attention mechanisms and weight allocation
effectively reduce conflicts between modalities. Our best-performing model, Fusion(AW), achieves over 70% balanced
accuracy and a Sharpe ratio of 4.33 annually, outperforming single- and dual-modal approaches. Out-of-sample tests
during recessions demonstrate the model’s resilience in volatile markets. This research has broad implications for invest-
ment decision-making and paves the way for further exploration of multimodal data in financial modeling.
